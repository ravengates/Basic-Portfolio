    <h1> Raven Gates</h1>

    <p> I grew up in a small town, and recently moved to Dallas. I have a retail ecommerce store
        in the design district. One plus in running my own business, is that I get to bring my 
    100 pound german shepherd to work everyday.
  </p>

    <p> Aside from owning a retail ecommerce store, I would like to eventually learn how to 
        create and design my own website. Learning code will help me navigate through the back 
        end of my website better, gather analytics my current website is not tracking and much more.
